DupScout is a very simple program, it searches a computer or network for duplicate files, which have the same name and contents. DupScout can search local disks, network shares, NAS storage devices and enterprise storage systems, allowing the user to then manage those rogue files. If you don't wish to make changes until you're sure, you can simply print a report of these duplicates and show them to users who may want to keep the files. Otherwise, they can be deleted, moved or replaced with links, to make them easy to find again. Reports can be exported in many formats, even pie charts.
